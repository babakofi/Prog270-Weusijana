<h1>History of Mobile Learning</h1>

<p>The term m-learning or "mobile learning", has different meanings for
different communities, that refer to a subset of e-learning,
educational technology and distance education, that focuses on learning
across contexts and learning with mobile devices. One definition of
mobile learning is, "any sort of learning that happens when the learner
is not at a fixed, predetermined location, or learning that happens
when the learner takes advantage of the learning opportunities offered
by mobile technologies." In other words, with the use of mobile
devices, learners can learn anywhere and at any time.</p>
<p>M-learning technologies include handheld computers, MP3 players,
notebooks, mobile phones and tablets. M-learning focuses on the
mobility of the learner, interacting with portable technologies, and
learning that reflects a focus on how society and its institutions can
accommodate and support an increasingly mobile population. There is
also a new direction in m-learning that gives the instructor more
mobility and includes creation of on the spot and in the field learning
material that predominately uses smartphone with special software such
as AHG Cloud Note. Using mobile tools for creating learning aides and
materials becomes an important part of informal learning.</p>
<p>M-learning is convenient in that it is accessible from virtually
anywhere. M-learning, like other forms of e-learning, is also
collaborative. Sharing is almost instantaneous among everyone using the
same content, which leads to the reception of instant feedback and
tips. This highly active process has proven to increase exam scores
from the fiftieth to the seventieth percentile, and cut the dropout
rate in technical fields by 22 percent. M-learning also brings strong
portability by replacing books and notes with small RAMs, filled with
tailored learning contents. In addition, it is simple to utilize mobile
learning for a more effective and entertaining experience.</p>
